	--> Use segemnation for each process.

MultiThreading:

Running Several Threads with in the same process.
These Threads share memory and resources. Part of the same program.

Threads are light weight compared to process.


Concurrency:

When a task is broken down into smaller pices which can run simultaneosly we are said to achieve concurrency.

	Run simulataneosuly :
	-- Taks (process ) in multi tasking environment.
	-- Thread in multiThread manner
	-- Distribution of work across a grid or cloud.
